### Analysis Paralysis

"an inability to make a decision due to over-thinking a problem, particularly when there is too much data to process"

### What is this?

I work as a consulting data scientist and have a background in academic research (PhD in Political Science).

In my free time, I frequently work on side projects to explore new methods and techniques for my work in consulting. This website serves as a repository for some of my work, most of which is devoted to board games and hockey.

I am avid user of R and the tidyverse, and I love using techniques from data science to (over) analyze the world of boardgames, hockey, and other things. 

But mostly boardgames.
