# What is this?

My name is Phil Henrickson and I work as a consulting data scientist in Madison, Wisconsin for AE Business Solutions. This website serves as a repository for some of my side projects, most of which are devoted to board games and hockey. I love using techniques from data science to (over) analyze the world of boardgames, sports and other things. 

## Analysis Paralysis

"an inability to make a decision due to over-thinking a problem, particularly when there is too much data to process"

or, an adequate description of my constant state of being.
