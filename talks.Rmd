## Presentations Delivered

I frequently deliver talks at analytics meet ups and organizations throughout the Midwest. These are a sample of some of the presentations I've given in the last few years.

#### Now What? Model Building, Science, and Analytics ([slides](https://github.com/phenrickson/talks/blob/main/now_what.pdf))

Organizations increasingly speak about being data-driven, but should this be our goal? In this talk I discuss philosophy of science and how we learn from data. 

#### What is this thing called data science? ([slides](https://github.com/phenrickson/talks/blob/main/what-is-this-thing-called-data-science.pdf))

Data science is on the roadmap for many organizations. What is data science? What can it do? What can it not do? 

#### The Talk on Talks ([slides](https://github.com/phenrickson/talks/blob/main/talk-on-talks.pdf))

This is a compilation of advice and lessons I've learned from years of giving presentations and talks.
