## Talks I've Given

I frequently deliver talks at analytics meet ups and organizations throughout the Midwest. These are a sample of some of the presentations I've given in the last few years.

1. [**Now What? Model Building, Science, and Analytics**](https://github.com/phenrickson/talks/blob/main/now_what.pdf)

Organizations increasingly speak about being data-driven, but should this be our goal? In this talk I discuss philosophy of science and how we learn from data. This, naturally, leads to an exploration of expected goals models in minor league hockey.

2. [**What is this thing called data science?**](https://github.com/phenrickson/talks/blob/main/what-is-this-thing-called-data-science.pdf)

Data science is on the roadmap for many organizations and businesses. What exactly is data science? What can it do? What can it not do? 

3. [**The Talk on Talks**](https://github.com/phenrickson/talks/blob/main/talk-on-talks.pdf))

I've given a lot of talks as a professor and as a consultant. This a compilation of advice and lessons I've picked up over the years from giving talks. Massively inspired by a presentation my advisor gave in grad school.
